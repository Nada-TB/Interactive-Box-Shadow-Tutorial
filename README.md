# boxShadow-tutorial

## Idea origin: 
When I started learning CSS, I struggled with properties that have multiple values. I spent time trying to be familiar with each value's function; interactive tutorials helped me a lot! Box-shadow was my bÃªte noire; in memory of those coding baby steps, I decided to build this mini-tutorial on how box-shadow works.
